## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This has been an interesting exercise. I've been trying to create my own utility folder to create things fasted based on the things that I normaly used. Never the less I've stumbled upon a couple of problems that make it hard to overwrite styles. But has been interesting.
I realized that if you want to change the color of the input when it is in "focus" you need to use the "outline" property instead of the border. I spend some minutes in there figuring out what was going on with that.

### Continued development

I need to keep practicing javascript. The solution that I came up with is too obvious and I feel that I'm not taking advantage of the programing language. I need to make it simpler and more reusable.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://github.com/KirstChat/pod-request-access-landing-page/blob/master/js/script.jsm) - This is the solution @KirstChat used for another challenge and I thought it worked really good. So I used it here.
